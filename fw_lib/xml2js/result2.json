The few words I had to communicate in that meeting were as follows: I believe it is needful, and would be profitable, when we are thus met together, diligently to watch against all such thoughts as we know ought not to have place in our minds. After I sat down, I felt such quietude, peace and composure, and a love that seemed to me to be new, that for some days I felt as if I had got into a new world. I loved not only my nearest connections, but all mankind, and even brutile creation, with a new love. This was such a confirmation of my being right, that I though it would never be erased, come on me what might. I felt as if I could turn my back on the world, and, if required, live like a hermit in the wilderness. Notwithstanding this confirmation of having been in my place at that time, I began to think that if ever it should be required of me again to say any thing in a public meeting, I should have a still more clear evidence of duty. Under this conclusion, I put off, and deferred speaking again for nearly a year; until I was in great danger of being quite bewildered on that hand. But as this kind of reasoning and false conclusion produced unsettlement, disquietude, and confusion of mind, so I found it safest to yield obedience to the clear manifestations of duty, without making a standard of my own.\n\t\t\t\t\t","$":{"resp":"transcr"}}]}],"floatingText":[{"$":{"type":"letter"},"body":[{"div":[{"$":{"type":"letter"},"opener":[{"dateline":[{"placeName":["\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLiverpool\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"],"date":[{"_":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Month 10, 1772.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","$":{"when":"1772-01-10"}}]}],"salute":[{"_":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t–\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","persName":[{"_":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohn\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","$":{"key":"w6n9820p"}},{"_":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEsther Hunt\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","$":{"key":"w6wx87x7"}}]}]}],"p":["\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy right dear and well beloved little cousins it is with feeling nearness and uniting regard I now salute you, desiring above all things you study obedience to the truth as it is manifested by the witness thereof not in any exalted notions of high imaginations but in the low valleys of deep humility where the secret mysteries is unsealed and the counsel and purpose of true wisdom respecting us open in a very intelligible manner, which as attended to with integrity and firmness strength is received a adequate for every trust reposed so as to come up in a faithful discharge of the same the reward whereof is peace and the running of rivers of joy by the fertile banks of Shiloh's fountain where the soul drinks deep draughts and is refreshed grows strong being brought to the shepherds tents it feeds on heavenly bread and becomes well disciplined in its warfare as a good soldier is able to endure hardness and trials for truth's cause.
